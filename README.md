# Flames
simulates flames in a retro style.

This code uses 32 set colour codes from white to orange to red

The code checks the colour code in the pixel below and sets itself to the colour code 1 shade down

The bottom of the window is programmed as a permanent white layer 

There is a decay constant with which the flame in each pixel has a chance of disappearing eacn flame

There is also a sideways propagation constant such that a pixel jumps to the left randomly
